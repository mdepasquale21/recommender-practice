# recommender-practice
A repository to practice with recommendation engines.
The examples use LightFM (https://making.lyst.com/lightfm/docs/home.html).
The movie-recommender is taken and modified from https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-movie-recommender-system-in-python-using-lightfm-8fa49d7cbe3b and the book-recommender from https://towardsdatascience.com/recommendation-system-in-python-lightfm-61c85010ce17.
